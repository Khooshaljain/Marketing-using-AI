# 🧠 AI in Marketing – Customer Segmentation using ML

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on applying **Machine Learning techniques** to perform **customer segmentation** for a retail analytics company.  
By analyzing **2.5 years of customer data**, the goal was to identify distinctive customer groups and design **targeted marketing campaigns** that enhance sales and customer engagement.  

The project was done as a **team of 3**, where I led the development of the ML model, ensuring data preprocessing, feature engineering, and clustering strategies were effectively implemented.
